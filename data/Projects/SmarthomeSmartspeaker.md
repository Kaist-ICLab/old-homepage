As time at home increases due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic and non-face-to-face services are spreading, the roles of smart home are rapidly expanding. Beyond simple environment monitoring and home appliance control, smart home technologies must consider new user needs such as health care, remote work, and education. In this project, we aim to explore data-intensive smart homes by developing a novel interactive service for proactive health management (e.g., smart speaker apps). Data-intensive future smart home will be prototyped to investigate practical challenges that may arise in the process of collecting and analyzing extensive data (e.g., security/privacy, data quality, and mental models). Furthermore, we design and implement a middleware layer that supports seamless data collection from heterogeneous smart devices and enables data analytics pipeline and interactive data visualization.
